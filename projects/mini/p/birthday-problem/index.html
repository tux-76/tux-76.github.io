                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday problem</a> is one of those counterintuitive statical facts. I discovered it <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Zobrist_Hashing">here</a>  when reading about the probability of hash collsions in a Chess AI. It reads quite simply:
            </p>
            <p>
                If you gather 23 randomly selected people in a room, what is the probability that at least two of them will share a birthday? (Assuming that each of the 365 days have equal probability, excluding leap years for simplicity.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Intuition says the probability is low. After all, it's 23 people out of 365 possible days. But in reality, there is more than a 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday! No tricks!
            </p>
            <p>
                The key here, as Wikipedia explains, is that each pair of the 23 people must be considered.
                This means the first person would compare with 22 people, the second with 21 (excluding the first), and so on.
                Mathematically: 22 + 21 + 20 ... 2 + 1 = 253. So, intuition can reason that out of 253 pairs of people, the likelyhood for a single shared birthday is higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                To remove the magic of statistics, I made an emperical proof for the concept. 
                This program randomly assigns birthdays and compares them.
                As you run trials, the percentage of shared birthdays will update, and you will see the percentage approach 50.73%, validating the statistical calculations.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, enjoy playing around with this little proof of concept. You may change the number of people and run up to 1 million tests in one click.
                Also, to give personality to your test subjects, they have randomly generated first and last names :-) (<a href="https://grok.com">Grok</a> very kindly made me a list)
